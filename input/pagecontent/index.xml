<p>hThe HL7 Terminology Change Set Implementation Guide defines FHIR R4 profiles, extensions, and value sets to allow medical terminology authoring organizations to distribute incremental content releases to healthcare organizations in a native FHIR format.

<p><strong>A care plan</strong> is a tool that helps ensure that you get the right care at the right time to stay as healthy as possible.</p>

<p><strong>A healthcare technology expert</strong> is someone who helps healthcare teams use new technology. They make sure the technology is set up correctly, train the staff to use it, and provide ongoing support. Their goal is to improve healthcare using technology.</p>

<p>Long-term health issues like asthma, diabetes, or depression are called chronic conditions. Sometimes people have more than one chronic condition, which we call multiple chronic conditions. Care plans help make sure that nothing important is missed, which is especially important for people with many healthcare needs. Care plans also help prevent conflicts in treatments by improving communication among healthcare teams, people needing healthcare, and their caregivers.This helps create stronger partnerships in managing chronic conditions to help people build plans of care that help them be as healthy and functional as possible.</p>

<p>The step-by-step instructions in this guide are for building electronic care plan systems. These systems help healthcare providers give dependable, steady, and safe care for people with <strong>multiple chronic conditions</strong> across different healthcare places. The guide contains specific rules that are needed in United States healthcare.</p>

<p>Healthcare technology experts worked with patients, caregivers, and clinicians to create this guide. This guide contains important information and guidelines for healthcare technology professionals to use when building care plan tools.</p>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
Custodians of standardized terminologies have developed rich semantic frameworks that can be used to interact with individual concepts in an elegant fashion, utilizing the relationships between terms to dynamically adjust user interfaces or derive clinical patterns. Today, these frameworks are distributed via proprietary formats and are tailored to the specific source terminology. As a result, any system looking to utilize the full semantic power of the terminology must build customized data pipelines to process those formats.
</p>
<p>
This Implementation Guide (IG) provides profiles and implementation guidance on utilizing the CodeSystem resource for exchanging terminology change sets that include full semantic detail from the source terminology. Change sets are intended to be a distribution format used for a specific version of a specific terminology, and not used to support operational transactions on a Terminology Server. The expected result of ingesting a change set is that the Terminology Server should be prepared to make content from the new version of the terminology available. This IG also addresses exchanging Terminology Change Sets containing concepts not yet incorporated into published source terminology versions, such as those requiring rapid distribution during a pandemic-response context. Analysis of semantic detail to include in a change set is informed by the <a href="TinkarOverview.html">Tinkar Standardized Terminology Knowledgebase Reference Model</a>, and mappings from that architecture are included on CodeSystem profiles.
  </p>

	<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
The design for Terminology Change Sets is primarily a robust utilization of the CodeSystem resource's modelling for <code>CodeSystem.concept</code> and <code>CodeSystem.property</code> to convey not just the concept identifiers and descriptions, but the full semantic design for each concept.  Additionally, a Provenance instance is used to provide insight into the creation of the Terminology Change Set, particularly using <code>Provenance.what</code> to reference the baseline Terminology from which the change set was derived.
