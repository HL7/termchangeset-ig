  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
Custodians of standardized terminologies have developed rich semantic frameworks that can be used to interact with individual concepts in an elegant fashion, utilizing the relationships between terms to dynamically adjust user interfaces or derive clinical patterns. Today, these frameworks are distributed via proprietary formats, tailored to the specific source terminology, and any system looking to utilize the full semantic power of the terminology must build customized data pipelines to process those formats.
</p>
<p>
This IG provides profiles and implementation guidance for exchanging terminology change sets that include full semantic detail from the source terminology utilizing the CodeSystem resource.  It also addresses exchanging terminology change sets containing provisional concepts not yet incorporated in source terminologies, such as those requiring rapid distribution during a pandemic-response context. Analysis of semantic detail to include  in a change set is informed by the <a href="TinkarOverview.html">Tinkar Standardized Terminology Knowledgebase Reference Model</a>, and mappings from that architecture are included on CodeSystem profiles.

	<h3>Technical Overview</h3>
	<p>
The design for Terminology Change Sets is primarily robust utilization of the CodeSystem resource's modelling for <code>CodeSystem.concept</code> and <code>CodeSystem.property</code> to convey not just the concept identifiers and descriptions, but the full semantic design for each concept.  Additionally, a Provenance instance is used to provide insight into the creation of the Terminology Change Set, in particular the use of <code>Provenance.what</code> to reference the baseline Terminology from which the Change Set was derived.
