  <p>Over the past decades, biomedical terminologies have increasingly been recognized as key resources for knowledge
management, data integration, and decision support [1]. Acceleration and development of Electronic Health Record
(EHR) systems has precipitated the emergence of “standard terminologies” and their widespread adoption in the
clinical community. These include Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT®), the
Logical Observation Identifiers, Names, and Codes (LOINC®) and RxNorm. The availability of these clinical
terminologies through the terminology services of FHIR is facilitating their usage in support of interoperability in
healthcare.</p>
<p>
Interoperability requires standardized semantics based on reference terminology provided by standards development
organizations, professional organizations, or government agencies. These organizations publish their content with the
intention of licensing it to health IT vendors, providers, and research organizations. In the U.S., the core clinical
reference terminology is based on SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm. Healthcare organizations must adopt and
integrate subsets or modules of various reference terminology and manage references, dependencies, versions, and
releases. It is important for the integrity of medical records that the change history of concepts and value sets can be
managed and tracked to allow the exchange of either current or retrospective medical records. Therefore, enterprise
terminology requires integrated terminology using a common representation and management.</p>
<p>
Despite the need to use standard terminologies in a highly integrated way, there is no standard representation across
SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, RxNorm, etc. Some partnerships have been created among development teams to facilitate
interoperability and minimize duplication of effort. Further integration has been proposed but will require additional
resources to bring these terminologies closer together. However, while this evolution leads to greater compatibility
and interoperability, integration of SNOMED CT®, LOINC®, and RxNorm is non-trivial as these terminologies use
different formalisms and tools for their representation. Various terminologies have different semantics, models, release
cycles, and versioning mechanisms [1]. While there is recognition that terminologies are not standardized at the
exchange level, there is no consensus about harmonized next steps to solve the challenges.</p>
<p>
This document focuses on the need for – and logical specification of – a Terminology Knowledge Architecture (Tinkar).
The Tinkar Reference Model is a logical model that describes the standardized model for terminology and change
management. Tinkar provides an architecture that delivers integrated terminology to the enterprise and its information
systems. In doing so, it addresses the differences in management and structure across reference terminology, local
concepts, and code lists/value sets.</p>
<p>
The Capability Maturity Model is a development model and can be viewed as a set of structured levels that describe
how well the behaviors, practices, and processes of an organization can reliably and sustainably produce required
outcomes. There are five levels defined along the continuum of the Capability Maturity Model (see below). The model
provides a theoretical continuum along which process maturity can be developed incrementally from one level to the
next. An implementation of the Tinkar Specification can provide a single representation for all terminologies required
in the U.S. and other countries, while also providing a better foundation for maturing change management models as
described by the Capability Maturity Model [2]:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Initial</b> – Tinkar aims to reduce and eliminate challenges with management of changes to terminology being
unpredictable, poorly controlled, and reactive.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Repeatable</b> – Tinkar provides the foundation for robust configuration management and quality assurance for
terminologies.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Defined</b> – Tinkar allows terminologies to have standardized update and extension processes.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Managed</b> – Tinkar represents updates and changes to terminologies so that the changes can be measured and
controlled.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Optimizing</b> – Tinkar aims to allow multiple stakeholders to apply and retrieve changes to shared terminology
content with equivalent and harmonized results.
      </li>
    </ol>
  <h3>Motivation: Why Tinkar?</h3>
  <p>
Information systems that are used across the healthcare enterprise record and manage clinical data using clinical
statements and clinical terminologies in non-standardized ways. Interoperability specifications aim to require
terminology bindings to concepts, code systems, and reusable value sets. Currently, there is variation in clinical
data exchange across the enterprise, as existing payloads and clinical statements use inconsistent and highly variable
enterprise terminologies. The management of the concepts, code systems, and value sets is non-trivial because
developers, implementers, and end users are forced to manage “unnecessary complexity.” For example:
  </p>
  <ul>
      <li>
        Representation of medications: RxNorm codes overlap with CVX codes. Investigational vaccines from the FDA
are not represented in RxNorm, CVX, or SNOMED CT®.
      </li>
      <li>
        Representation of COVID-19 result codes are inconsistent and are not equivalent (e.g., detected, undetected,
positive, negative, etc.).
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
As a result of these complexities, there are many ways to say the same thing using standard terminologies and standard
formats. The Institute of Medicine report, Health IT and Patient Safety: Building Safer Systems for Better Care,
highlighted the unintended consequences of health IT-induced harm that can result in serious injury and death due
to dosing errors, failure to detect serious illnesses, and delayed treatment due to poor human-computer interactions,
confusing clinical terminology, or unreliable data quality [3]. Despite the widespread understanding of the importance
of the quality of clinical data, there is currently a lack of integration and management of clinical terminologies across
the healthcare enterprise.
  </p>
  <p>
Tinkar intends to support integration of clinical terminology and local concepts to support increased data quality
for interoperable clinical information. High-quality clinical data enables healthcare systems across the enterprise to
conduct robust and meaningful data analysis and increase overall interoperability, which ultimately enhances quality
of care across all medical facilities.

management describe preventable harm that Tinkar addresses:
