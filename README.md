This branch is the active branch for applying issues and trackers for the Continuous Integration (CI) Build for the Tinkar Terminology Exchange Implementation Guide. All issues should be logged using the official [Jira tracker system](http://hl7.org/fhir-issues) so they can be reviewed and voted upon by the HL7 Terminology Infrastructure Work Group. See the Directory of published versions for a list of Tinkar Terminology Exchange versions and change log.
